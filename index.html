 		The game will either be called “Gingerbread Run” or “Gingy on the Run” and take place in Fairytale Village where there are witches, talking animals, princesses, regular village people, and of course talking gingerbread men. The main character of the game is Gingy the Gingerbread man, a gingerbread man who was brought to life by the Muffin Man- who also lives in the village.  The problem is, Gingy is currently the only talking gingerbread man in the village and some of the animals and witches in the village have been trying to get a bite of Gingy!
